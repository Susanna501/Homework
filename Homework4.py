''' 10.You should create two good new exercises using your ideas.'''

'''Task 1- The company planning to build 105 floors building, 
every floor height will be 4.2 meter. The result convert in kilometers'''

h = 4.2 
floor = 105
res1 = h * floor
kilometers = 1000 	#1 Kilometer = 1000 Meters, 1m =0.001km
result = res1 / kilometers
print(result)

'''Task 2- Gas utility cost is 55 000,calculate how cub meter gas cost is?(convert to AMD), 
where 1 cub meter gas is 1.5$'''

dollar_1 = 522.5     		# 1usd = 522.5 amd  
cub_meter = 1.5 			# 1cb m = 1.5 usd
res = cub_meter * dollar_1
utility = 55000 / res
print(utility)
